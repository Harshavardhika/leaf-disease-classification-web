# 🍃 Leaf Disease Classification using ResNet34 & VGG16

This project uses deep learning to detect and classify plant leaf diseases. It fine-tunes two powerful CNN architectures—ResNet34 and VGG16—on a labeled dataset of healthy and diseased leaves. The goal is to assist farmers and agronomists in early disease detection. A user-friendly Streamlit interface enables real-time prediction by uploading a leaf image. The models are trained and evaluated using the PlantVillage dataset, achieving high accuracy.
